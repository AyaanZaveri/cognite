## ðŸ¤” What is it?
It's a fast and simple way to **share** and **create** chatbots with external knowledge such as a website or a document. This can be helpful for things like creating bots for knowing specific things, such as a research paper, a book, etc.

## ðŸ¥– How do I use it?
- To find chatbots just start typing on the search bar on the homepage and find what you need
- To create a chatbot, head to the create page. Put in a name and give it some knowledge (website or PDF as of right now)

## ðŸŒŽ How does it work?
ðŸ¦œ [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs) for the AI backend such as the embeddings and chat  
<img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/nextdotjs/000/fff" alt="Next" width=16> [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) as the full-stack framework  
<img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/prisma/000/fff" alt="Prisma" width=16> [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) to interact with the database in an easier way  
<img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/tailwindcss/06B6D4/fff" alt="Tailwind" width=16> [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the UI framework and CSS

**Embeddings**: It uses [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to create embeddings for the knowledge provided.  
**LLM**: It currently uses GPT-3.5-Turbo, but you can use whatever LangChain currently [supports](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)
